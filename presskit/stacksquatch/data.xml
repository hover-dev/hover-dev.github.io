      <text>Physics-based stacking and interactions were always a real draw to VR for me. The prototype of Stacksquatch played perfectly to the strengths of the new medium: the awe of scale, the precision of the controllers, and very little risk of nausea. It was also a good excuse for me to use my own Vive Grip product.</text>

      <header>Realization</header>
      <text>I wanted to work with others to bring it all together. I picked each member of the team for commission work because of their unique, cozy, and sometimes quirky style of art that I felt represented the soul of Stacksquatch. This was my first time working with a team of freelancers this size but they made it easy and were a pleasure to work with.
